      <h1>The Little Ones</h1>
      <p class="intro-pets">In my life, I was always limited to having 1 pet at a time due to the huge responsibility that involves having them. Good thing is, every time I had one, I was very lucky because they left unforgettable memories. Please join me on exploring each one of them.</p>
      <h2 class="silvestre">Silvestre, the Wild Green Parrot</h2>

        <figcaption><p>Silvestre was one of a kind. The background story on how I ended up with him may seem like fiction but I encourage you to read it. One day, I was at a local mall, where my mother used to work. I was walking down the hallway when I saw a small green bird far in the distance. Funny thing is, he was also walking down the hallway, just like as if he was shopping at the mall. I was able to get close enough to it, just to watch him climb in my shoe and notice how cute of a bird he was. I decided to take him to the veterinary since I knew something had to be wrong with him (or at least I never saw a bird shopping at a mall before). The veterinary said that everything seem to be ok with him, but that he was an extremely rare wild parrot. Silvestre and I seemed to have a strong connection so I decided to keep him. I used to leave his cage open and he used to fly around the neighborhood and then come back later in the afternoon (unbelievable isn't it?).</p></figcaption>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/rocko.jpeg" alt="Rocko's picture">
        <figcaption><p>Rocko came in a very unexpected manner. One day I was passing by a place that I used to see small pupies being sold out and I noticed something really strange. I saw that there was a family of Wiener dogs that looked very sad and unfed. My sister decided to take action and report it for animal mistreatment. However, there was a problem, these dogs had nowhere to go. My mom then decided to take action and adopt at least one of them ... the only survivor after all. The other pupies died from diseases due to the condition they were in, but Rocko survived thanks to our care. He is a very hyperactive, friendly, and smart dog, which makes him very special. Sometimes I think that he has a stronger pull than a pitbull (he is so strong!).</p></figcaption>

      <h2 class="chiqui">Chiqui, the Dog of the Pack</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/chiqui.jpg" alt="Chiqui's picture">
        <figcaption><p>I didn't had the luck to be there in Chiqui's earlier years. She was adopted my uncle about 13 years ago. He said that he had to read a book about Jack Russells due to their unique personality and character. Apparently, they are dogs of a pack. They like to follow an alpha and obey that alpha for the rest of their life. However, it seems they also strive to become an alpha themselves, which is why the books advices that you must become an alpha for them or they will become your alpha (they will not obey you). Also known to be hunter dogs for hunting foxes, Chiqui loves chasing anything that moves (rats, squirrels, bunnies, etc). Even though she is 13 years old, she still very active and happy.  </p></figcaption>
